  <h2 class="text-light">About Sifu Lloyd Wright</h2>
  <p>
    Sifu Lloyd Wright is a 4th Dan Black Belt in the Yee’s Hung Ga system of traditional Chinese martial arts.
    With over 25 years of teaching and a lifelong dedication to the art, he leads the Midtown NYC branch of the
    Hung Family Kung Fu school with humility, precision, and strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    His lineage connects directly back to Grandmaster Frank Yee (Yee Chi Wai), and his classes emphasize not just
    combat techniques, but also discipline, health, and cultural tradition.
  </p>

    Students of all levels are welcome — from absolute beginners to seasoned martial artists looking to deepen
    their practice.
